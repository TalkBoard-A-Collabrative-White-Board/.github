**TalkBoard** is a real-time collaborative whiteboard platform built for teams, classrooms, and communities who
want to think together—without the distraction of video. It combines audio communication with a powerful
shared canvas, enabling people to brainstorm, teach, explain ideas, and co-create in the most natural way.
From drawing and writing to shapes and images, TalkBoard gives the host full control while keeping 
collaboration smooth, secure, and reliable. It’s designed to feel personal, fast, and meaningful—like being in 
the same room, even when you’re not.
